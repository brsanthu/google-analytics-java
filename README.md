** Breaking Changes in upcoming 2.0.0 (Not ready for consumption yet) **
---------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.0 is refactoring of majority of structure of the library with goal of making library
easy to use and make it feel fluently. It is based on Java 1.8.

Because of this, API of 1.x branch is not compatible with 2.x. However, due to lack of time, no
changes are planned for 1.x branch so if you need any changes, please check out 2.x branch. At this time,
you have to build the snapshot yourself but I will work on pushing that to snapshot central.
